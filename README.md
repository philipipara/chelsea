I took my favorite soccer team and decided to make a little website dedicated to
them and some of my favorite players. The picture carousel I went to Chelsea's
website and grabbed them from the source pages. The reason for me building a simple website was to get back to working on responsive web design using media
queries to refresh myself on it. If you're a Chelsea fan looking at this, let's
talk Chelsea!
